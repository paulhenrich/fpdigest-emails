Talks
======

Clear your schedule, 26 hours of CodeMesh talks are up ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWbHc_FXPo2hGJHXhpgqDU-P4BArpCdh6)), including:

* [Joe Armstrong interviews Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY&feature=youtu.be)
* [Why The Free Monad isn't Free  by Kelley Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EQWNiwgT4o&list=PLWbHc_FXPo2hGJHXhpgqDU-P4BArpCdh6&index=19)
* [Type-driven Development of Communicating Systems in Idris by Edwin Brady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OTilXFHayk&list=PLWbHc_FXPo2hGJHXhpgqDU-P4BArpCdh6&index=24)

RubyConf ("it's an acceptable lisp") talks are also online, and there are a couple of particular interest to FPers:

* [Ruby versus the Titans of FP by Cassandra Cruz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25u-pp-7PHE) - A discussion of some of the big ideas in FP, and to the speaker's library, Reductio, which provides currying and composition in Ruby.
* [To Clojure and back: writing and rewriting in Ruby by Phill MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doZ0XAc9Wtc&index=64&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyaMUYwB6tTX5p2Z6fOCdGRE&t=495s) - Mostly a retrospective about architecture decisions (don't start with microservices!). Criticisms of Clojure include: stacktraces are still too hard, docs are too terse, and it's hard to find the golden path for large systems architecture vs strong conventions in Ruby on Rails.

Java and Scala
===

A new paper & companion site demonstrate that [Java & Scala Type Systems are Unsound](http://io.livecode.ch/learn/namin/unsound) and have long been so. Interestingly this isn't a JVM-level issue. From the paper: "As type systems become more advanced, it becomes more important for types to provide guarantees that are not invalidated by implicit nulls."

QuickCheck Paper
======
This week I'm reading [the Quickcheck paper](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf) by Koen Claessen & John Hughes (2000). QuickCheck [(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) was originally written for Haskell but now has implementations in a number of languages. The basic idea is to test your programs with a huge range of generated inputs.


Elsewhere
==============

* GHCVM is Haskell on the JVM. This post shows how you can use it to [extend Minecraft with Haskell](https://ncrashed.github.io/blog/posts/2016-10-22-ghcvm-minecraft-modding.html).

* [Replacing GenEvent with a GenServer](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/11/replacing-genevent-by-a-supervisor-genserver/) - a post about Elixir/OTP.
* [Handling Overload](http://ferd.ca/handling-overload.html) - Covers patterns for handling overload in Erlang, broadly applicable to distributed systems.
* [Elixir Strings, Charlists, Binaries, etc. for Rubyists](https://medium.com/@harry_dev/elixir-for-rubyists-charlists-binarys-strings-iolists-eeacf38db999) - relevant for anyone new to Elixir or Erlang wondering what all the different string-ish types are about.

Unix Books
==========
I thought some of you may be interested in this $1-$15 (pay what you want) sale of
a [bundle of O'Reilly Unix/Linux books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/unix-book-bundle).
