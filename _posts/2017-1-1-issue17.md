Advent of Code
==============
Last month I sent a link to Advent of Code, a series of daily programming puzzles. Peter Norvig participated and 
[published his solutions in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb) to the puzzles
in a Jupyter notebook.

Idris
==========
[Idris 0.99 has been released](http://www.idris-lang.org/idris-0-99-released/). Idris is a "dependently typed", eagerly evaluated language.

> A dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value. A "pair of integers" is a type. A "pair of integers where the second is greater than the first" is a dependent type because of the dependence on the value. -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type)
