Talks
=====
* Videos are now up from [Compose Conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNoHgLVTxtaqo1c_V2I-8wkDrCGImb9v5) are up on YouTube. Lots of Haskell and Scala talks.
* Raheel Ahmad explains [Monads and Other Function Paradigms in Practice](https://realm.io/news/slug-raheel-ahmad-using-monads-functional-paradigms-in-practice-functors-patterns-swift/). This is a good introduction to FP concepts
especially for programmers using Swift.
* [Elixir London videos are up](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWbHc_FXPo2ivlIjzcaHS9N_Swe_0hWj0). Hat tip to Paul Sturgess who [wrote up](http://paulsturgess.co.uk/blog/2016/09/29/elixir-london-conference-2016/) the conference.
* [More ElixirConf videos](http://confreaks.tv/events/elixirconf2016) are now online

Posts
=====
* [Modern Functional Programming: Part 2](http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp-part-2) - a proposed architecture for functional programming with examples in PureScript.
* [Benchmarking Scala Collections](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html)
* Not a new post, but new to me: [Understand and implement laziness with examples in Scala, JavaScript, Swift and Racket](http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-laziness/)
  * Relatedly, a 2014 post of interest to those trying to understand lazy evaluation: [How Lazy Evaluation Works in Haskell](https://hackhands.com/lazy-evaluation-works-haskell/)
