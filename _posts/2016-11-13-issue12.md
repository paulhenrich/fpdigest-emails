Morning Paper
=============
If you're interested in keeping up with CS research and don't yet know about Adrian Colyer's [morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/), I recommend it. A review of an interesting paper from CS posted every weekday morning.

Frameworks are Fundamentally Broken
===================================
Tim Perrett argues that [frameworks are the wrong abstraction](http://timperrett.com/2016/11/12/frameworks-are-fundimentally-broken/) because frameworks do not compose, and because
each new framework carries with it a learning curve pertaining to its specific design choices and terminology. Instead the right abstracion should be portable. Or, (for example) Functors > Frameworks.

Clojure
=======
* Interactive [Island Generator](http://exupero.org/hazard/post/islands/) blog post. More procedural map generation with ClojureScript & Klipse.
* [Advanced Martian](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/advanced-martian.html), a follow up to [Intro to Martian](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/martian.html), which is a Clojure library for writing http API clients.
* [What we miss from Clojure](https://blog.appcanary.com/2016/missing-clojure.html) - AppCanary rewrote their Clojure codebase in Ruby and reflects on what they miss.
* [EuroClojure recap](http://corgibytes.com/blog/2016/11/08/bratislava-conferences/)

Elixir
======
The Changelog [open sourced their Phoenix web site](https://changelog.com/posts/changelog-is-open-source) at the end of last month

Category Theory
===============
[Covariance and Contravariance](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/11/covariance-contravariance), an exploration of category theory terms in Haskell code.

"Typeclasses such as Bifunctor are often expressed in terms of whether they are covariant or contravariant. While these terms may appear intimidating to the unfamiliar, they are a precise language for discussing these concepts, and once explained are relatively easy to understand."
