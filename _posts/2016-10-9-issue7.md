Talks
=====
Erlang User Conf 2016 videos are up---[full playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWbHc_FXPo2ijLaWEw-L2xtTVMQ5chWcp):

* [Erlang and Deep Learning by Garrett Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMhBEVCgPdg&list=PLWbHc_FXPo2ijLaWEw-L2xtTVMQ5chWcp&index=8) - "The Deep Revolution"
* [Building a Graphical IDE in Elm by Claudia Doppioslash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfeneg48POY&list=PLWbHc_FXPo2ijLaWEw-L2xtTVMQ5chWcp&index=35)

[Haskell Exchange talks](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7276-haskell-exchange-2016#skillscasts) are also up (free registration required):

* [Haskell programs: how do they run? by Tom Ellis](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8726-haskell-programs-how-do-they-run)
* [Haskell in the Large by Donald Stewart](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9098-haskell-in-the-large-the-day-to-day-practice-of-using-haskell-to-write-large-systems) - experience report from Standard Chartered


Links
=====
* [Nightlight, an embedded web-based editor for Clojure projects](https://sekao.net/nightlight/) was released. Cool idea that brings editor tooling to the idea of live production REPL (console) access.
* [A practical introduction to functional programming (in Python)](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming)
* A thread on the Elixir subreddit with [project suggestions for learning concurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/55n6vt/elixir_project_suggestion_for_learning_concurrency/)

CDRTs
=====
I've been reading a lot about CDRTs---Conflict-Free(/Convergent/Commutative) Replicated Datatypes---recently. Wikipedia's page on [CDRTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) gives a good overview. In short, CDRTs let you encode conflict resolution for distributed systems in the data type.
At ElixirConf I learned that CDRTs underlie Phoenix's new presence system. [This tweet by Phoenix maintainer Chris McCord](https://twitter.com/chris_mccord/status/711934423877480448) and ensuing thread highlight some of the more recent and accessible papers in the field.

Language Highlight
==================
[Pixie](http://pixielang.org/) is a pre-alpha, "small, fast, native lisp with 'magical' powers". Pixie
will be familiar to Clojure programmers, taking much inspiration from its standard library.

One area where Pixie shines is scripting. If you wish you could write scripts in Clojure but
can't due to the JVM startup time, consider Pixie.


Upcoming Conferences
====================
* Oct 25-26: [EuroClojure](http://euroclojure.org) will be in Bratislava
* Nov 2-4: [Code Mesh](http://www.codemesh.io) in London
* **Nov 11-13 (newly noted)**: [Scala By The Bay](http://scala.bythebay.io/) in San Francisco.
* Dec 1-3: [Clojure Conj](http://2016.clojure-conj.org) in Austin
* Dec 8-9: [Scala eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7432-scala-exchange-2016#program) in London
* Feb 9-10: [Lambda Days](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017) Krak√≥w, Poland (CFP open)
