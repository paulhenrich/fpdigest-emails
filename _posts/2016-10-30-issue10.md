Functional Conf Talks + John Hughes
=====
Talks from [Functional Conf (playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Z-JgiTsOYTdi91N_DlcpWqkCYvMrhA4) in Bangalore are up.

Of special note: [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrNdvWqxBvA) by John Hughes, the author of [the seminal paper of the same name](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) [pdf] digs into his original argument, the history of FP, and surveys other papers.

Haskell
=======
* A self-described [OOP developer tries Haskell](https://blog.cotten.io/learn-me-a-haskell-5970bf4ac206) using [tryhaskell.org](http://tryhaskell.org).
* A talk about [Beautiful folds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a5Ti0r8Q2s) in practice.
* [Fast Tests and Static Languages](http://www.shimweasel.com/2016/10/24/fast-tests-and-static-languages) and a [followup](http://www.shimweasel.com/2016/10/27/haskell-testing-desiderata) describe how one haskeller runs their tests.

Pattern Matching in Clojure
================
You may be familiar with pattern matching from Erlang or Elixir. The idea is to use multiple function heads that match on the data structure passed in, for example on its values or shape. Clojure has destructuring in function definitions, but I just learned that you can do pattern matching as well, via core.match [(docs)](https://github.com/clojure/core.match/wiki). If this sounds interesting, check out this reader submission: [Core.match Interactive Tutorial](http://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/10/25/core-match.html).
