CRDTs revisited
=====
This week, I learned about [Lasp](https://lasp-lang.org), which uses CRDTs (see last issue) as
a first class concept. Lasp stands for "Lattice Processing" in a nod to Lisp (List Processing).

I also learned that I misspelled CRDT in the last issue. (Thanks Jason for the correction)

Clojure.spec
============

I got to see a preview of Carin Meier's upcoming talk about clojure.spec ([docs](http://clojure.org/about/spec)) and genetic programming
at our local functional group. Don't miss it at EuroClojure if you're going.
