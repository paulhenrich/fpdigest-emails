Hi. Welcome to Issue 3 of [FP Digest](http://fpdigest.com), where I aim to share topics and links of interest to functional programmers. Thanks for subscribing and please tell your friends and colleagues if you find it interesting. -Paul

This Week
=========
If you're in St Louis this week for Strange Loop or otherwise:

* Sept 15: [Papers We Love Conf](http://pwlconf.org/)
  * [free for students](https://twitter.com/papers_we_love/status/775109838158327808)
* Sept 15: [elm-conf](http://www.elm-conf.us/)

Let's Be Mainstream
===================

Functional Programming can seem daunting to the beginner because it is often
discussed in academic language. This has the benefit of being precise for computer
scientists, but can be a barrier to entry if it's the only way we talk about Functional Programming. ["Let's Be Mainstream"](http://www.elmbark.com/2016/03/16/mainstream-elm-user-focused-design) is
Evan Czaplicki's philosophy for Elm and the inspiration for this section.

In her talk [Pure Functional Programming in Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yKf8TrLUOw) Felienne Hermans explains that Excel is live, pure functional programming for the masses.
FP beginners will find the analogies to Excel useful in understanding a number of FP concepts. Beyond this, the talk offers a view into how people across the world are building ad hoc software and research into applying what we've learned
in software development to help these every day programmers (for example, testing).

Haskell and Purity
==================
> "You can---and most people do---do arithmetic without understanding or even knowing about rings."

-[Haskell, Monads and Purity](http://jelv.is/blog/Haskell-Monads-and-Purity/) on how to think about IO and State in Haskell

A Tiny Lisp Computer
====================

> "This article describes a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega328, that you can program in Lisp."

This is super neat: a [Tiny Interactive Lisp Computer](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1GX1) running the author's uLisp.
