This week
=========
[Commercial Users of FP](http://cufp.org/2016) is in Nara, Japan starting on the 22nd.

Paul Chiusano writes about [the advantages of static typing](https://pchiusano.github.io/2016-09-15/static-vs-dynamic.html).

A wealth of [Strange Loop videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw?feature=autonav) are already up mere days after the conference. Among them:

* [Put a Type On It: Idris Type Providers for AWS Resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMPum88xluE) - Can you represent 3rd party APIs with types? Idris is a dependently-typed language, but this talk is aimed at developers coming from a more "mainstream stack".
* [Agility & Robustness: Clojure spec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNTQ-M_uSo8)
* [PureScript & Pux -- a safer, more expressive way to React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE4ToMtTmz4) - A quick intro to FP in the web browser, PureScript, and a framework for front end development.
* [Systems Programming as a Swiss Army Knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfD9IMZ9rKY) - Debugging using OS-level tools.

Additionally, [FullStackFest published 33 talk videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf76DOOKMkDpyo_A5PfZk7JWc) this week. The opening keynote was given by Joe Armstrong, [Computing: The first 100 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itKFrXghGuA&index=2&list=PLe9psSNJBf76DOOKMkDpyo_A5PfZk7JWc).

J
=
At Cincinnati FP last week we got a "short, painful* introduction to J" from [Joe R Smith (@solussd)](https://twitter.com/solussd). The talk wasn't recorded,
but you can view the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/solussd/a-short-painful-introduction-to-function-level-programming-with-j).

J has a concise syntax (perhaps being charitable). It's inspired by APL and is well-suited for matrix math. And it can do neat things like compute the inverse of a "verb" (a tacitly-defined function). Whoa. http://www.jsoftware.com

"* that's your brain expanding"
